# Data-Visualization-using-Microsoft-SQL-Server-SSMS-and-PowerBI-Sales-Project

This project aims to display various skills involving the use of SQL and PowerBI. It will showcase many methods of cleaning and organizing data followed by steps to visualize the data in order to achieve a given task by a company, freelance employer, etc.  


Example Task email used for this project:
  Hello,

  We want to move our internet sales reports to a visual dashboard format from a static report format. Additionally, we would like a deep dive into customer and product sales so we may be able to adjust manufacturing and      marketing to best suit our needs. Please note that we have a team of sales people that each work with various products and customers, so we would like to be able to filter by those variables. 

  Please use the budget spreadsheet we sent to analyze budget performance. The budget is from 2013-2014.

  Thanks,
  Company Project Director


Given this task, I created a dashboard using organized csv files to display relevant information such as least purchased products, budget vs sales, customer sales location and more. 

The data used for this project is gathered from the Microsoft Adventureworks 2022 sample database which contains data relevant to the years specified in the email.

The software used for this project is Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio 19, Microsoft Excel and PowerBI. 

Note: Global security settings must allow for map usage in order to see every element in the PowerBI Dashboard.
